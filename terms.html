                <h4>Disclaimer </h4>
                <p>These Terms and Conditions (Terms) contain the terms under which you may access this 
                website and purchase an item listed on this website. You agree to be bound by these Terms. 
                Floral Fusion Service may amend these Terms from time to time and any amendment will 
                become effective immediately. Your continued use of this website after any amendment by Floral 
                Fusion Service constitutes an agreement to abide by and be bound by these Terms, as 
                amended.</p> <br>

                <h4>DELIVERY POLICY</h4>
                <h5>Standard Delivery:</h5>
                <p>A delivery fee of $10 will be added to your order, plus a Fuel Surcharge which may vary from 
                time to time. The current Fuel Surcharge is stated below.
                The order cut-off time for Next Day Delivery is 2:30 pm in the delivery location on the day prior to 
                delivery. If you place your order after 2:30 pm (in the delivery location), we cannot guarantee that 
                delivery will occur on the next day.
                Please note that there are some remote locations that cannot be guaranteed for Next Day 
                Delivery. We will notify you at point of your purchase (if this is during normal business hours) if 
                we think that we will be unable to deliver your order next day. </p> <br>

                <h5>Same Day Delivery:</h5>
                <p>A fee of $5.00 will be added for Same Day Delivery.
                The order cut-off time for Same Day Delivery is 1:00 pm in the delivery location. If you attempt to 
                place your order after 1:00 pm in the delivery location, you will not be able to select Same Day 
                Delivery as an option.
                Please note, Same Day Delivery is not guaranteed for all areas, and is not available for certain 
                products. </p> <br>

                <h5>Delivery Times</h5>
                <p>Delivery times will depend on your location. Generally deliveries occur:
                • Monday to Saturday: 8am – 5pm (9pm for residential addresses)
                • Sunday: No deliveries (other than on Valentine’s Day and Mothers’ Day)
                • We do not deliver on public holidays.
                • Occasionally there are delays beyond our control. Flat tyres, traffic jams or bad weather can 
                cause delays. If you request a specific time of delivery, we will make every effort (but do 
                not guarantee) to deliver at the requested time.</p> <br>

                <h5>Delivery Instructions </h5>
                <p>Our couriers do not call prior to delivery. Please ensure the recipient is home to receive items.
                If no person is present to accept the order at the location specified, our driver will act at their 
                discretion based on weather conditions, safety, security, etc.
                Where a secure location is not available, our couriers will leave a note advising the recipient to 
                contact Floral Fusion Service to arrange for re-delivery. We will charge you $17.95 for the cost of 
                re-delivery, but will contract you for authorization prior to charging this fee.
                If you provide us with an incorrect delivery address, you must pay $10 for re-delivery of your 
                order to the correct address. We may also charge you for the cost of new flowers if we need to 
                replace the original flowers. </p> <br>

                <h5>High Volume Occasions</h5>
                <p>The cut off and delivery time parameters do not apply to busy floral occasions including, but not 
                limited to; Mothers’ Day, Valentine's Day and Christmas. Please check our website for expected 
                delivery times on those days and make sure to place orders in advance to ensure timely delivery.
                Delivery Date
                The delivery date selected is the approximate date of arrival. Sometimes logistics, traffic, 
                distance and weather conditions can cause delays. We cannot guarantee the exact delivery date 
                or specific time. </p> <br>

                <h5>SUBSTITUTION POLICY </h5>
                <p>Images found on this site are used for display purposes only. Actual products may differ from 
                product images displayed.
                If a product is unavailable in the delivery location, prior to delivering your order you will be 
                contacted to select an alternative product or authorize Floral Fusion Service to substitute for a 
                product that is in stock. Floral Fusion Service takes utmost care and attention to ensure that any 
                substitutions are as similar as possible to the requested item. </p> <br>

                <h5>Substitution Details </h5>
                <p>Where a specific flower type or colour is unavailable within the given time frame of delivery, 
                Floral Fusion Service will use types or colours that achieve the same overall shape, style and 
                effect.
                In arrangements of assorted flowers, the colours shown online will be used if at all possible, even 
                if this means substituting other kinds of flowers of greater value.
                For one-of-a-kind flower arrangements, such as all roses or all lilies, we will make every attempt 
                to match the flower type, but may substitute with another colour.
                For one-of-a-kind plants, such as orchids, we will make every attempt to match the plant type, 
                but may substitute with another colour.
                In arrangements of assorted flowers, the colours shown online will be used if at all possible, even 
                if this means substituting other kinds of flowers of greater value.
                Gourmet Gifts & Specialty Items (including, but not limited to, Fruit and Gift Baskets, Cookies, 
                Cakes, Chocolates, Teddy Bears, Balloons, and Vases): These items may be substituted with 
                another specialty item of equal or greater value and of similar theme and category. Images of gift 
                baskets represent number of product included, type and actual product variety will vary.</p> <br>

                <h5>ALCOHOL POLICY</h5>
                <p>You must be 18 years or older to purchase any alcoholic products from us. If you are purchasing 
                an alcoholic product, you warrant to Floral Fusion Service that you are 18 years or older and that 
                the recipient of the product is 18 years or older. Floral Fusion Service will not be liable if any 
                underage person purchases or receives an alcoholic product. You indemnify Floral Fusion 
                Service for any loss or damage suffered by Floral Fusion Service for a breach by you of this 
                warranty.</p> <br>
